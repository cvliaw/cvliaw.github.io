Hi! I am a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Nick Harvey](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nickhar/). I also enjoy working with [Hu Fu](http://www.fuhuthu.com/). I am broadly interested in randomized algorithms, machine learning theory, and mechanism design.
